"""Performance middleware — Sprint 8 Part 4.

Two responsibilities:

  1. **Response compression.** Attach Starlette's GZipMiddleware so
     JSON / text responses larger than the configured minimum are
     served as ``Content-Encoding: gzip``. nginx is the public
     compressor; this is the in-process backup for direct-to-
     backend traffic (dev, tests, ops runs ``curl`` against
     ``localhost:8000``).

  2. **Cache headers on the health surface.** ``/health`` and
     ``/health/ready`` change on every request, so the middleware
     stamps ``Cache-Control: no-store, max-age=0`` so a CDN /
     browser does not serve a stale readiness verdict. The
     ``/metrics`` endpoint is also marked no-store so a
     Prometheus scraper retry never sees a cached payload.

The middleware is order-sensitive. ``install_performance`` wires
the compressor so it sits INSIDE the security headers (so the
``Content-Encoding: gzip`` header is included in the security
header audit) but OUTSIDE the request handlers (so it can
short-circuit on small payloads).
