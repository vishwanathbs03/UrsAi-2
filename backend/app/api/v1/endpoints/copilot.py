"""AI Business Copilot endpoint.

  * POST /business/copilot/chat  — orchestrate
    the existing engines to answer a free-text
    business question.

The endpoint is a thin wrapper around
:class:`~app.services.copilot.CopilotService`.
The service is responsible for every derivation
rule; the endpoint does:

  1. Authenticate the request (JWT / cookie).
  2. Validate the request body.
  3. Construct the service with the
     request-scoped :class:`BusinessRepository`.
  4. Call ``service.chat(owner_id, message)``.
  5. Translate the service's exceptions into
     HTTP status codes:
       * :class:`BusinessNotFound` → 404
       * :class:`CopilotServiceError` → 500
  6. Validate the resulting dict against the
     response schema so an unhandled code path
     fails loudly at the API boundary, not
     silently in the UI.

Authentication: required. The owner is resolved
from the JWT subject; clients cannot pick an
owner_id.

Database writes: never. The Copilot does not
mutate the business profile or any upstream
service.

What the endpoint does NOT do
-----------------------------

  * call out to OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Ollama,
    or any LLM
  * store conversation history
  * stream responses
  * use a websocket
  * maintain a chat memory
  * maintain a vector database or embeddings
