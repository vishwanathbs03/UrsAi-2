"""QuestionUnderstanding — SPRINT AI-1 universal assistant Stage 1.

Before the assistant can answer ANY business question, it must
first understand WHAT the user actually asked. The existing
:class:`~app.services.ai.providers.intent_router.QuestionIntent`
enum is a 6-way classification that neatly maps to the flagship
demo questions, but it is a **routing boundary today** — any
prompt that does not match a flagship keyword falls back to a
generic consultant template or, in the worst case, is rejected
as "unrecognized intent".

This module is the AI-1 fix. It introduces a richer
:class:`QuestionUnderstanding` dataclass that:

  * captures the literal question text,
  * assigns a coarse :attr:`topic` (finance / marketing / operations
    / hiring / export / strategy / education / risk / scenario /
    general) that the system can act on,
  * records the :class:`QuestionIntent` value the existing
    :func:`classify_intent` would have produced, as
    :attr:`relevant_existing_intents` (a tuple, since a prompt
    may overlap multiple intents and the legacy system used
    priority — we keep the same priority order here),
  * detects when the prompt is unambiguously non-business
    (:func:`is_purely_educational`) so the backend can auto-flip
    its internal mode to ``open`` while preserving the wire
    ``mode`` field the user picked,
  * records the **complexity** (simple / moderate / strategic /
    scenario) that the adaptive answer composer keys off,
  * records what the user wants the assistant to compute
    (:attr:`needs_calculations`) and which deterministic engines
    it should consult (:attr:`needs_deterministic_services`),
  * records what is unknown (:attr:`unknowns`) so the
    :class:`AdaptiveAnswer` composer can switch to a
    ``missing_info`` shell.

The dataclass is ``frozen=True`` so it can be safely shared
across the reasoning pipeline without defensive copying.

Backward-compatibility
----------------------

The five existing flagship intents remain reachable via
:attr:`relevant_existing_intents`. The existing
:func:`build_intent_frame` call sites are NOT changed — they
still call :func:`classify_intent` directly. ``QuestionUnderstanding``
is the AI-1 layer that **augments** the routing, not replaces
it. Prompts that match no flagship intent still get a useful
``topic`` (e.g. ``"marketing"``) and a useful ``complexity``
(e.g. ``"strategic"``), so the system never falls back to
"I don't recognize this intent."

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class QuestionUnderstanding:
    """Stage 1 output — structured understanding of the user prompt.

    Attributes
    ----------
    literal_question
        The raw prompt text (trimmed). Preserved so downstream
        renderers can echo the question verbatim when helpful.
    user_intent
        A short dotted path describing what the user wants
        (e.g. ``"operational.finance.working_capital"``). NOT
        used as a routing key — it is informational metadata for
        the prompt builder and the audit trail.
    topic
        Coarse topic bucket — one of the :data:`Topic` literals.
        Defaults to ``"general"`` when no keyword matches.
    is_business_specific
        True when the prompt references the user's own business
        (uses ``"my"``, ``"our"``, ``"I should"``, the profile
        industry, location, etc.). False for purely educational
        questions.
    is_purely_educational
        True when the prompt is explain / define / compare
        against a non-business subject matter. Determined by
        :func:`is_purely_educational`. Used by the backend to
        auto-flip its internal ``_effective_mode`` to ``"open"``
        while the wire ``mode`` stays as the user picked.
    needs_calculations
        Calculation labels the user implicitly asked for. One
        of ``"gap_math"``, ``"growth_multiple"``, ``"roi"``,
        ``"working_capital"``, ``"headcount_cost"``,
        ``"scenario_delta"``. Empty tuple when no calculation is
        needed.
    needs_deterministic_services
        Service names the assistant should consult. Reuses the
        existing service names from the deterministic pool
        (``"health_score"``, ``"recommendation"``,
        ``"schemes_sprint16"``, ``"finance"``,
        ``"knowledge_retrieval"``, ``"business_dna"``,
        ``"risk"``, ``"insights"``). Empty tuple when no
        service is needed.
    unknowns
        Context fields the assistant would need to answer this
        question well but the user has not provided. Drives the
        ``missing_info`` shell in the adaptive answer composer.
    relevant_existing_intents
        The :class:`QuestionIntent` values the existing
        classifier would have produced. Always at least one
        element (the default is ``QuestionIntent.GENERAL``).
        Order is priority order so the prompt builder can pick
        the first as the primary framing.
    sentiment
        ``"neutral"`` / ``"concerned"`` / ``"optimistic"`` —
        simple keyword scan. Defaults to ``"neutral"``.
    complexity
        One of ``"simple"``, ``"moderate"``, ``"strategic"``,
        ``"scenario"``. The adaptive answer composer keys off
        this to pick a shell.
    parsed_at
        ISO-8601 timestamp of when the understanding was
        produced. Useful for the audit trail.
