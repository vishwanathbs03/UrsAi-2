"""SQLAlchemy engine, session factory, and declarative base.

Sprint 8 Part 4 — the engine now honours the settings-driven
``db_pool_size`` / ``db_pool_max_overflow`` / ``db_pool_pre_ping``
knobs. SQLite ignores the pool settings but the others apply
cleanly; for the Postgres path the operator sizes the pool to
match the gunicorn worker count.

Sprint 9 Part 2 — adds ``bootstrap_schema()`` so a fresh database
is created from SQLAlchemy metadata at the first connect. The
function is idempotent and safe to call from every worker
(lifespan runs once per worker under gunicorn).

Sprint H2 — Database, Migration & Deployment Integrity.
The bootstrap path is now driven by Alembic (the canonical source
of truth for the schema) rather than ``Base.metadata.create_all``.
This guarantees that ``alembic upgrade head`` and a fresh
``bootstrap_schema()`` produce the same schema, and that the
``alembic_version`` row matches the head revision the codebase
expects. The metadata-based fallback is retained as a last-resort
safety net for environments where Alembic cannot import (e.g. a
corrupted install) so the API can still come up.
