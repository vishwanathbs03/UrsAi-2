"""Repository for the Business Digital Twin.

The repository owns SQL access for every business-related table. The
service layer is the only consumer; endpoints never touch the
session directly.

Design notes
------------

* One business per user. ``get_by_owner`` enforces that invariant on
  the read path. ``create`` enforces it on the write path by raising
  ``BusinessAlreadyExists`` if the owner already has a row.
* The nested tables (products, certifications, ...) are not loaded
  lazily through relationships. The repository hydrates them with
  explicit queries after the parent row is fetched so we can compose
  them into a single ``BusinessOut`` deterministically.
* Updates replace the nested collections wholesale. This is the
  simplest contract for a wizard: PUT is the source of truth, the
  client sends the full new state for any section it changed.
