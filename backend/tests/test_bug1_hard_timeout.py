"""Regression test for BUG-1 — hard wall-clock timeout on LLM calls.

Root-cause target
-----------------

Before H7.9R+ the ``AssistantProviderService.generate`` path could
hang indefinitely when a configured upstream (e.g. Gemini) was
unreachable but the connection had not yet triggered the provider's
own ``httpx.Client(timeout=...)`` budget. The chat endpoint would
then hold a worker thread until the FastAPI request timeout (or
the test harness) finally killed it, with no fallback ever firing.

The fix wraps every outbound ``provider.complete(request)`` call
in a hard wall-clock cap (15 s) and falls back to the
deterministic provider the instant the cap fires. The chat
endpoint therefore always returns within the budget; the frontend
never waits forever.

These tests assert
  (1) the wrapper exists and is exported,
  (2) the cap ceiling is the committed ``HARD_CALL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS``,
  (3) a fast stub provider still returns the real provider's response,
  (4) a slow stub provider triggers ``TimeoutError`` from the
      wrapper well before the provider's blocked duration, and the
      wrapper releases the provider (``close()`` is called).
