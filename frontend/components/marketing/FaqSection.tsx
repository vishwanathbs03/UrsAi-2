    q: "What is UrsBiz and how does it help my business?",
    a: "UrsBiz is an AI-powered Business Intelligence Platform designed for MSMEs. It creates a digital twin of your business profile to compute a 0-100 Business Health Score, automatically match 25+ government schemes (like PMEGP, CGTMSE, Mudra), generate daily priority briefings, and export bank-ready PDF executive reports.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does UrsBiz guarantee government scheme approval?",
    a: "UrsBiz evaluates your operational profile against official ministry eligibility rules to deliver high-confidence match scores (%) and step-by-step application document checklists. Final sanctioning rests with the respective government sanctioning authority.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does the AI engine avoid hallucinations?",
    a: "UrsBiz uses a deterministic rule engine for financial scoring and subsidy eligibility so every score and matching percentage is traceable to the input business profile and the cited rule. For natural language queries, it pairs vector RAG search over official government gazette guidelines, and the UI clearly distinguishes calculated scores from scenario estimates.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does it take to onboard my business profile?",
    a: "Onboarding takes less than 2 minutes. Simply fill out our 4-step wizard detailing your turnover, sector, workforce size, and state to instantly view your health score and eligible schemes.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I export reports for bank loan applications?",
    a: "Yes! With one click, you can download audit-ready executive PDF and CSV reports formatted for bank loan applications, CA reviews, and investor presentations.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there a free tier available for small businesses?",
    a: "Yes, UrsBiz offers a free core tier allowing business health score calculation, basic scheme matching, and dashboard access with zero credit card required.",
